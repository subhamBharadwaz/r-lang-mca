Q. Explore different functions in R about strings, arrays, vectors, factors. You may also explore 
different methods of plotting the data

ANS
1. Strings:

i) paste(): Concatenate strings together.
ii) strsplit(): Split a string into substrings based on a delimiter.
iii) gsub(): Replace occurrences of a pattern in a string with a specified replacement.
iv) toupper(): Convert characters to uppercase.
v) tolower(): Convert characters to lowercase.

2. Arrays:

array(): Create a multi-dimensional array.
dim(): Get the dimensions of an array.
apply(): Apply a function to margins of an array (rows or columns).
rbind(): Combine arrays by row binding.
cbind(): Combine arrays by column binding.




3. Vectors:

c(): Create a vector.
length(): Get the length of a vector.
sum(): Calculate the sum of vector elements.
mean(): Calculate the mean of vector elements.
min(), max(): Find the minimum and maximum values in a vector.


4. Factors:
factor(): Convert a vector into a factor.
levels(): Get the levels (unique values) of a factor.
table(): Create a frequency table for a factor.
cut(): Create intervals and convert numeric data to a factor based on those intervals.
reorder(): Reorder levels of a factor based on the values of another variable.

Different methods of plotting data:

1. Base R plots:
plot(): Create scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, etc.
hist(): Create histograms.
boxplot(): Create box plots.
pie(): Create pie charts.


2. ggplot2:

ggplot(): Create complex and customizable plots using a grammar of graphics approach.
geom_point(), geom_line(), geom_bar(): Add points, lines, and bars to the plot.
geom_histogram(), geom_boxplot(): Create histograms and box plots using ggplot2.


3. lattice:

xyplot(): Create conditioned scatter plots (xy-plots) with panels.
barchart(): Create conditioned bar charts.
bwplot(): Create conditioned box-and-whisker plots.


4. Plotly:

plot_ly(): Create interactive and 3D plots.
add_trace(): Add traces to the plot for multiple data series.
layout(): Customize the layout and appearance of the plot.
